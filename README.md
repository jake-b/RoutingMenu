Recreate the experience of deleting a note on your Newton, but on your Mac.

In celebration of [WWNC 2020](http://wwnc.online), here is the source to a little app that "deletes your screen" in Apple Newton style.

This app was not intended for release.  It was intended as a final effect for use in [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-h0pKj9rmhgRX3KomvSCow)

As such, the application doesn't even have the ability to quit.  You'll have to force-quit it somehow.

The code is very ugly.  It was a means to an end and written quickly for a single use.  Maybe someone else will enjoy it.

If you give it the ability to "Record Your Screen", then the app will use your screen as part of the animation.   The app was written before this security stuff was part of macOS.
